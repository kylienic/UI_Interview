# UI_Interview

Disney UI Internship Interview, Spring 2016
Developer: Kylie Nicholson

Data format: xslx to CSV to JSON
Data parsing method: handwritten javascript methods 

Libraries used: bootstrap, chart.js

index.html: resume page
data.html: data page 
data.js: data with formatting in tact ($ for sales values)
data_raw.js: data without formatting 

javascript transition: smooth scrolling script at the top of data.html

image: image of self on resume page

charts/ visualizations: 8 on data.html

I learned a lot developing this project, particularly in the data section. I already know multiple improvements I will make in version 2.0 (assuming this project continues):

Improvements for V 2.0:
1. Add legends next to charts on data.html -- done
2. Add formatting for output on scales ($ for sales)
3. Add formatting for pie chart tooltips (% or $ based on context)
4. Sort tables based on sales value for Sales per Employee (using Google charts, much simpler once I migrate over)

Lessons learned:
1. chart.js is far more limited than I needed it to be; next time I will use a different charts library. For V 2.0 I will use Google charts for the following reasons:
	1. Interactivity between charts and graphs
	2. Sorting capabilities within charts
2. Dealing with data in a self-contained site (not hosted) is tricky! It took me awhile to figure out how to handle all the data locally. I had never done this before. 
3. Colors are extremely important, easy to get wrong and difficult to get right. They communicate a lot. 

Thank you for a fun and engaging project! - Kylie
